### About me

I'm a programmer looking for the best every day, keeping in mind that I will never reach a limit, always having to evolve!

I try to solve problems in smart ways, I like to innovate.

I consider teamwork very important.

I like to put all my knowledge into practice, even if it's negligible.

Why nothing you know is worth anything if you don't apply!
